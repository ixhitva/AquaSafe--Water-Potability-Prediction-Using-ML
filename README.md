Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning | Interactive Website with Narration & Detection Tool

This project focuses on predicting the potability of water using machine learning techniques and provides a rich, interactive web application to visualize the results.

🔍 Key Features:
Machine Learning Model trained on real-world water quality data to predict whether water is safe to drink or not.

A fully functional website showcasing:
📊 Interactive graphs and visualizations that explain water quality metrics and model insights.
🗣️ Narration feature that lets users read or listen to the explanations, making it accessible and engaging.
💡 Water Potability Detector where users can input their own water parameters and get real-time potability predictions.
Designed to promote awareness about clean water and help users understand the science behind water quality assessments.

🚀 Tech Stack:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas (for model building)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask (for the web interface)
Chart.js / Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
Text-to-Speech (TTS) for narration feature
